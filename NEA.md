## Task Introduction

The task was to write a graphical game that can be played from any common desktop operating system (such as Windows, MacOS and common Linux distros).

I plan to develop a procedurally-generated[^1] roguelite[^2] game, using top-down graphics and a full 2D physics system. If possible, I also plan to implement multiplayer networking in the game.

### User Experience

- Opens into main menu.
- Play:
  - Leads to host/connect screen.
  - Hosting allows the user to create a new lobby that others can join.
  - Connect allows the user to enter an IP:Port pair and join another user's lobby.
  - Lobby screen should list players and their chosen classes, allows kicking and have a chat window.
  - Once all players are ready, the owner may start the game.
- In Game:
  - Each player begins with a chosen class.
  - Players should start in room, one exit must be present.
  - Players can attack and dash, as well as moving normally with the arrow keys or WASD.
  - Each player has 2 weapon slots and 2 item slots.
  - Selected item can be changed with num keys and scroll wheel.
  - Room is tile based with auto-tiling for smoother textures.
  - Mini-map at top right for discovered rooms.
  - Players can see other playerâ€™s locations on the map, but not their discovered rooms!
  - Objective is to find the exit room.
  - Rooms along the way may contain new items (combat rooms) or new weapons (chest rooms), or may even contain a shop.
  - Enemies should drop money and health in order to reward combat, and should have different strengths and weaknesses to make multiple classes more important.
  - Exit room encounter should be more difficult than rest of the dungeon.
  - Upon exit room, new dungeon should be generated once all players enter.
  - Upon death, players may spectate other living players.
- Settings:-
  - Audio volume,
  - Controls,
  - Networking,
  - Display (for UI scaling and window size, etc).
- Info:
  - Credits and more detailed information about this task.

## Design

### Libraries we need

This project will require some form of graphics rendering library, it will manage window creation and the process of interacting with the GPU to draw sprites and images to the screen.

I have chosen to use the [pyglet](http://pyglet.org/) Python library. For dependency management, I am using the [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) tool, which is used to isolate packages and avoid polluting the developer's global package list. This will not affect the project itself much and is purely an organisational decision.

In addition to pyglet itself, we will also need some form of 3D sprite implementation so we can layer sprites on top of each-other in a performant manner. I have chosen to use [this](https://github.com/LennyPhoenix/GCSE-CS-NEA/blob/main/src/zsprite.py) implementation.

### Application

I will need some form of core application class to manage the event loop, window, and game state. This is the "master" object.

- Play Menu - The application is displaying the host/join menu.
- Lobby Menu - The application is displaying the lobby menu.
- In Game - The player is in the game loop.
- Settings Menu - The application is displaying the settings menu.

The default state will be whatever we are currently developing to speed up the process, if the project is finished it should be the Main Menu.

### Physics System

I have opted to avoid using a library like Pymunk for my physics system as it provides too many unnecessary tools that ultimately make the game's codebase more complex than it needs to be.

My physics system needs to do a few basic things, and nothing more:

- Allow objects to detect collisions between each other
- Resolve collisions and avoid tunneling (using swept AABBs[^3])
- Mask out specific collision layers
  - e.g. enemies + enemy bullets do not need to collide
- Allow "move and slide" behaviour

  ![Sliding response to a swept AABB collision](https://uploads.gamedev.net/monthly_04_2013/ccs-146537-0-83526600-1366678432.png)

Something simple such as swept AABB collisions can solve this problem very easily and efficiently.

Once the physics system is correctly implemented we can begin work on the gameplay.

#### Space

The "space" is essentially the collection of physics entities.

In this case it can be implemented simply by defining the Space as a Python Set of [AABBs](#aabb).

#### Object 2D

This allows objects to be represented in 2D space, with positional inheritance.

Consider an object with no parent, the local and global position of that object will be equal as the object is in global space directly. If that object had another object as a parent, its position would be relative to the location of the parent object. The local position will no longer be equal to the global position as the global position is now equal to the local position *transformed by* the parent's global position, which in turn is calculated by the parent's parent's global position...

**Attributes:**

- x: float - The local X position of the object.
- y: float - The local Y position of the object.
- parent: Object 2D - The object's parent in space, may be None.
- global x: float - The global X position of the object.
- global y: float - The global Y position of the object.

#### AABB

An axis-aligned bounding box[^3], contains the logic for collision **detection** *(as opposed to resolution)*.
AABBs are represented as a position at the bottom-left, and a width and height extending to the top-right.
Inherits from Object 2D.

**Attributes:**

- *All of Object 2D.*
- w: float - The width of the box.
- h: float - The height of the box.
- layer: int - The bitmask of the layers this box may be detected on.

**Methods:**

- *Is colliding AABB?*
  - Checks if the current AABB is intersecting with another given AABB.
  - Returns a boolean.
- *Is colliding point?*
  - Checks if a given point is within the boundaries of the current AABB.
  - Returns a boolean.
- *Get broad phase*
  - Creates a new broad-phase AABB for the current AABB and a given velocity.
  - This is used later for optimising collision resolution, a broad phase is essentially the total area the AABB could move through when travelling via a given transformation.
  - For example, box A is located at (10, 60) with a width and height of (20, 20), when box A moves by a transformation (100, -60), its broad-phase will be at (0, 10) with a width and height of (120, 80).

  ![Broad Phase - Black is the broad-phase, blue is the original AABB, green is the AABB's destination after the transformation.](https://uploads.gamedev.net/monthly_04_2013/ccs-146537-0-18508600-1366678566.png)
  
  - Returns a new AABB.

For testing and debugging purposes, we also will want some helper debugging methods:

- *Create Debug Rect*
  - Creates a new Rectangle shape, allowing the AABB to be displayed on screen.
  - Takes some basic options: colour, batch, and group.
- *Update Debug Rect*
  - Updates the position, width, and height to reflect the current properties

#### Collision Data

We need some way to store the data of a collision (whether the collision happened or not, the time during the transformation it happened, and the normals of the collision) easily.
To do this I will define a Python dataclass to store these attributes together.

#### Get Axis Collision Distances

This function will be used to calculate the distance to the entry and exit poitns of a collision on a **1D** axis.

Takes the positions and widths of two objects in 1D space, and the velocity of the first object.

Returns the entry and exit distances in a tuple.

#### Get Axis Collision Times

This function will be used to calculate the entry and exit times for a collision in **1D** space. Time returned is a float between 0.0 and 1.0, with 0.0 being right at the start of the motion and 1.0 being right at the end.

Takes the distance to the entry and exit points and the velocity of the object.

Returns the entry and exit times in a tuple.

#### Get Collision Normals

This function will be used to calculate the normals of a collision in **2D** space.

Takes entry times and entry distances both as 2D vectors.

Returns the normals as a 2D vector.

#### Body

A moving AABB in space. Will find the nearest/earliest collision in space and resolve the collision based on the body's velocity.

**Attributes:**

- *All of AABB*
- mask: int - The bitmask of the layers this body may detect/collide with.

**Methods:**

- *Get Collision Data*
  - Determines all the appropriate data surrounding the collision of the body with another AABB, and compiles the data into a `CollisionData` object.
  - Will need to calculate whether a collision has actually occured. A collision occurs if non of the following are true:
    - There was no motion, this happens if the entry time is greater than the exit time.
    - The collision happened in the past.
    - The collision happens more than 1 frame in the future.
  - Takes another AABB, and the body's velocity as arguments.
  - Returns the `CollisionData` object.
- *Get Nearest Collision*
  - Loops over all objects in space, and determines which object collides with the body first using the *Get Collision Data* method. The collision with the lowest entry time is the earliest.
  - We can use the AABB's broad-phase here to determine if a collision is even possible.
  - Takes the physics space (remember this is a Set of AABBs) and the body's velocity as arguments.
  - Returns the collision data of the earliest collision.
- *Move*
  - Gets the nearest collision and moves as far as possible in one iteration.
  - Takes the physics space and the body's velocity as arguments.
  - The body may move by the given velocity multiplied by the collision time. Because the collision time is a float between 0 and 1, a collision that happens half-way between frames will have a collision time of `0.5`. Multiplying the velocity by `0.5` will make the body travel half the distance, stopping it at the point of the collision.
  - We can then determine the remaining "deflection" velocity by using the normals of the collision in some vector maths.
  - Returns the remaining velocity as a 2D vector.
- *Move and Slide*
  - Repeatedly runs the *Move* function until the remaining velocity reaches a magnitude of 0, *or* if the maximum number of bounces[^4] has been reached.
  - Takes the physics space, the body's velocity and *optionally* the maximum number of bounces that may occur.

### Player

The user-controlled player object, uses a state machine.

**States:**

- Idle - No movement.
- Running - Standard movement with WASD.
- Dead - The player can no longer move.
- Default - Idle.

**Constants:**

- Max Health: int - The maximum health a player can have, will probably be 100.
- Speed: float - The number of pixels the player may move per second.
- Dash Multiplier: float - The amount that the player's speed is multiplied by while sprinting.
- Dash Length: float - The amount of time a dash lasts for.
- Dash Cooldown: float - The amount of time the player must wait between dashes.
- Dash Control: float - The amount of control the player has during a dash.
- Layer: int - The player's unique collision layer.
- Sprite Sheet: Pyglet Image - The image resource used for the player sprite.
- Idle Animation: Pyglet Animation - The animation for the idle state.
- Moving Animation: Pyglet Animation - The animation corresponding to the running and dashing states.
- Dead Animation: Pyglet Animation - The animation to occure when the Dead state is reached.

**Attributes:**

- *All of Entity*
- Keys - The key state handler used to keep track of user input.
- Current State - The state currently assigned by the player object.
- Input Vector: 2D Vector - The unit vector of the user's current directional input.
- Dash Velocity: 2D Vector - Used to store the initial velocity of a dash.
- Current Weapon - The currently selected weapon, may be none.
- Camera - The camera object to control the viewport, parented by the player object.
- UI - Contains the UI for the player, including inventory, money, and health.
- Inventory - List of the items in the player's inventory. Should only be 4 in length.
- Current Selection: int - The index of the currently selected item in the player's inventory.
- Current Health: int - The current health of the player. When this reaches 0 the state changes to Dead.

**Methods:**

- *Get Input*
  - Calculates the user input vector and normalises it.
  - This is done by adding to x and y velocity variables based on held keys in the Keys handler.
  - Returns the vector.
- *On Update*
  - Called once per frame.
  - If the player is in the Dead state, do not do anything.
  - If the player is in the Dashing state, counts down on the dash timer using the delta-time passed to the function.
  - Otherwise, counts down on the dash *cooldown* timer, stores the result of *Get Input* in the Input Vector attribute, and assigns either the Idle or Running state based on if that vector is 0 or not.
  - Also sent to the current weapon.
- *On Fixed Update*
  - Called 60 times a second.
  - If the player is Dead, do not do anything and return early.
  - Flips the sprite based on if it is moving to the right or left.
  - Calculates the speed of the player based on if they are dashing or not.
  - If the player is dashing, their velocity is locked but we still add some control to make the gameplay feel more responsive.
  - Multiply the speed by the input vector to calculate a velocity.
  - Run *Move and Slide* using the velocity and the physics space.
  - Rounds the Global Position to keep it pixel-aligned.
  - If colliding with an enemy, reduce health by the enemies damage. Use *Get Collisions*.
- *On Mouse Motion*, *On Mouse Drag*, and *On Mouse Button Down*
  - Sent to the current weapon.
- *On Key Press*
  - If the key is space, determine if a dash is possible[^5], and assign the dash state accordingly along with resetting the appropriate timers.
  - Change Current Selection to follow if the number keys from 1-4 are pressed.
    - Hide the previous item and show the new one. This is done by setting the item's sprite to use `invisible=True/False`.

**Events:**

- *Action Occured*
  - The user has attempted some action, such as movement, changing item, or using an item/weapon.
  - Sent to the **Game Manager**.

[^5]: The player can dash if the Dash Cooldown Timer is less than 0, and if the Input Vector is not 0. Essentially, the cooldown timer has expired and the player is moving.

### Enemy

Each enemy type should ideally have a unique movement and attack pattern to keep the game fun and interesting. Ideally, an enemy should be strong against one class and weak against another to encourage player cooperation.

**States:**

- Idle - The enemy is not moving.
- Attacking - The enemy is in the same room as a player.
- Dead - The enemy's health is 0.

**Constants:**

- Room - Reference to the room that this enemy is located within.
- Health: int - The current health of the enemy. Like the player, the state should change to Dead when this reaches 0.

**Methods:**

- *Calculate Path*
  - Takes the Tilemap of the Room, and uses the A-Star pathfinding algorithm to calculate a path towards a given location.
  - Returns the tiles in this path.
- *On Update*
  - If the state is Attacking, calculate a path towards the target location.
  - For melee enemies, the target location will be the position of the nearest player located in this enemy's physics space.
- *On Fixed Update*
  - Follow this path, when reaching a tile on the path, remove it from the path.
  - Use *Move and Slide* to move towards the target velocity.
  - If colliding with a player's weapon or projectile, reduce health by the weapon or projectile's damage. Use *Get Collisions*.

**Events:**

- *State Changed*
  - In server mode, occurs if an attribute of the entity is changed.

## Testing

Being a game, the program was fairly simple to test.

The process of testing simply involved running the application, and checking that the input did not result in unexpected behaviour.

The physics system was tested by implementing a debug rect, allowing the AABBs to be displayed on screen in order to better understand the boundaries of the colliders.

## Conclusion

Due to time constraints and heavy overscoping, it was not possible to finish implementing the project. At the end of the 20 hours, the todo list looked like this:

- [X] Project setup.
- [X] Application with Window, Batches and Events.
- [X] Game class with Camera and Player movement.
  - [X] Game Manager
  - [X] Physics system
    - [X] AABBs
    - [X] Physics Bodies
    - [X] Documentation
    - [X] Split up swept algorithm
  - [X] Player
    - [X] Movement
    - [X] Camera system (use groups)
    - [X] Dash
      - [X] Functionality
      - [X] Lock Velocity
    - [X] Sprite
    - [X] Animation
- [ ] Combat and player UI.
  - [ ] Weapon classes
    - [ ] Melee
  - [ ] Health system
  - [ ] Inventory system
- [ ] Dungeon generation.
- [ ] Enemies.
- [ ] Player classes and different weapons.
- [ ] Networking and player syncing.
- [ ] Chest rooms and combat rooms.
- [ ] Exit room.
- [ ] Main menu and UI.

I decided to also add a new `DeepProjection` class to allow us to use Z positions extending from -1 and 1.

If I were to continue, I would implement the melee weapon functionality, and continue down the todo list.
