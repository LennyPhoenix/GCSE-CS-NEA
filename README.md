# Computer Science Non-Examined Assessment (GCSE)

## Analysis

### Introduction

Write a graphical game that can be played from any common desktop operating system (such as Windows, OSX, and Linux).

### User Experience

- Opens into main menu.
- Play:
  - Leads to host/connect screen.
  - Hosting allows the user to create a new lobby that others can join.
  - Connect allows the user to enter an IP:Port pair and join another user's lobby.
  - Lobby screen should list players and their chosen classes, allows kicking and have a chat window.
    - Player can choose their class using a dropdown.
  - Once all players are ready, the owner may start the game.
- In Game:
  - Each player begins with a chosen class.
    - Breaker (Melee)
    - Runner (Ranger)
    - Tripper (Support)
  - Players should start in room, one exit must be present.
  - Players can attack and dash, as well as moving normally with the arrow keys or WASD.
  - Each player has 2 weapon slots and 2 item slots.
  - Selected item can be changed with num keys and scroll wheel.
  - Room is tile based with auto-tiling for smoother textures.
  - Mini-map at top right for discovered rooms.
  - Players can see other playerâ€™s locations on the map, but not their discovered rooms!
  - Objective is to find the exit room, leading to a completion.
  - Rooms along the way may contain new items (combat rooms) or new weapons (chest rooms), or may even contain a shop.
  - Enemies should drop money and health in order to reward combat, and should have different strengths and weaknesses to make multiple classes more important.
  - Exit room encounter should be more difficult than rest of the dungeon.
  - Upon exit room, new dungeon should be generated once all players enter.
  - Upon death, players may spectate other living players.
- Settings:
  - Audio volume
  - Controls
  - Networking
  - Display (for UI scaling and window size, etc)
- Info:
  - Credits and more detailed information about this task.

## Design

### Decomposition

- Application
  - The "master" object.
  - Controls:
    - The window
    - Drawing
    - Events
    - The current game state
  - Contains:
    - Main Menu
    - Lobby Menu
    - Game Manager
    - Network Manager
- Main Menu
  - Main menu user interface.
  - Controls:
    - Main menu elements
  - Contains:
    - Play Menu
    - Settings Menu
    - Info screen
- Settings Menu
  - Stores settings in a JSON file and saves to disk.
- Play Menu
  - Allows the user to host a new lobby or join an existing one.
  - Contains:
    - Text entry for username
    - Text entries for IP and PORT
    - Button to join a lobby
    - Button to host a new lobby instead
  - When the user joins or hosts a lobby, the respective method is called on the Network Manager, and control is handed over to the Lobby Menu.
- Lobby Menu
  - Allows the user to interact with the current lobby before the game begins.
  - Shows:
    - Player list and their chosen class
    - The current player can choose their own class from a menu
    - The IP:PORT pair
    - Chat window
  - Hands control over to the Game Manager once the game has started.
- Game Manager
  - Manages all the "game" processes. These include:
    - The dungeon itself
    - Entity management (Players, Enemies, Projectiles, Items, etc.)
    - Physics, likely using Pymunk
    - Win and loss conditions
    - Syncing data between clients
  - Contains:
    - Dungeon
    - Entity list
    - Players
    - Chat window
- Dungeon
  - Manages the dungeon layout.
  - Controls:
    - Dungeon generation
    - Room management
  - Contains:
    - Room data such as tiles and entities.
    - The dungeon layout
- Player
  - Controls:
    - Movement
    - Room traversal
    - Weapons and combat
    - Item usage
    - Money count
  - Contains:
    - The camera
    - Player UI (hotbar and health)
    - Inventory data
- Enemy
  - Each enemy type should have different movement and attack patterns.
  - Try to make 1 enemy for each class to help keep multiple classes important.
- Projectiles
  - Each should have a move function and lifetime value.
  - The most basic projectiles will just move forward each frame and collide with walls and entities.
- Network Manager
  - Can either create a server or connect as a client.
  - Manages all networking, including packets.
  - Host has full control, and should send dungeon and entity data to each client.
  - Clients compute their own player movement and resync with the host.
