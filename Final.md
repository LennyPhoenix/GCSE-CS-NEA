# GCSE Non-Examined Assessment

> Lenny Critchley, 2022

This file will cover a breakdown of my GCSE NEA project for 2022.

## Task Introduction

The task was to write a graphical game that can be played from any common desktop operating system (such as Windows, MacOS and common Linux distros).

## Plan 

I plan to develop a procedurally-generated[^1] roguelite[^2] game, using top-down graphics and a full 2D physics system. If possible, I also plan to implement multiplayer networking in the game.

### User Experience

- Opens into main menu.
- Play:
  - Leads to host/connect screen.
  - Hosting allows the user to create a new lobby that others can join.
  - Connect allows the user to enter an IP:Port pair and join another user's lobby.
  - Lobby screen should list players and their chosen classes, allows kicking and have a chat window.
    - Player can choose their class using a dropdown.
  - Once all players are ready, the owner may start the game.
- In Game:
  - Each player begins with a chosen class.
    - Breaker (Melee)
    - Runner (Ranger)
    - Tripper (Support)
  - Players should start in room, one exit must be present.
  - Players can attack and dash, as well as moving normally with the arrow keys or WASD.
  - Each player has 2 weapon slots and 2 item slots.
  - Selected item can be changed with num keys and scroll wheel.
  - Room is tile based with auto-tiling for smoother textures.
  - Mini-map at top right for discovered rooms.
  - Players can see other playerâ€™s locations on the map, but not their discovered rooms!
  - Objective is to find the exit room, leading to a completion.
  - Rooms along the way may contain new items (combat rooms) or new weapons (chest rooms), or may even contain a shop.
  - Enemies should drop money and health in order to reward combat, and should have different strengths and weaknesses to make multiple classes more important.
  - Exit room encounter should be more difficult than rest of the dungeon.
  - Upon exit room, new dungeon should be generated once all players enter.
  - Upon death, players may spectate other living players.
- Settings:
  - Audio volume
  - Controls
  - Networking
  - Display (for UI scaling and window size, etc)
- Info:
  - Credits and more detailed information about this task.

## Design

I plan to use the Pyglet cross-platform graphics library for window management and sprite drawing, the physics solution will instead be developed from scratch.

### Decomposition

- Application
  - The "master" object.
  - Controls:
    - The window
    - Drawing
    - Events
    - The current game state
  - Contains:
    - Main Menu
    - Lobby Menu
    - Game Manager
    - Network Manager
- Main Menu
  - Main menu user interface.
  - Controls:
    - Main menu elements
  - Contains:
    - Play Menu
    - Settings Menu
    - Info screen
- Settings Menu
  - Stores settings in a JSON file and saves to disk.
- Play Menu
  - Allows the user to host a new lobby or join an existing one.
  - Contains:
    - Text entry for username
    - Text entries for IP and PORT
    - Button to join a lobby
    - Button to host a new lobby instead
  - When the user joins or hosts a lobby, the respective method is called on the Network Manager, and control is handed over to the Lobby Menu.
- Lobby Menu
  - Allows the user to interact with the current lobby before the game begins.
  - Shows:
    - Player list and their chosen class
    - The current player can choose their own class from a menu
    - The IP:PORT pair
    - Chat window
  - Hands control over to the Game Manager once the game has started.
- Game Manager
  - Manages all the "game" processes. These include:
    - The dungeon itself
    - Entity management (Players, Enemies, Projectiles, Items, etc.)
    - Physics Space
    - Win and loss conditions
    - Syncing data between clients
  - Contains:
    - Dungeon
    - Entity list
    - Players
    - Chat window
- Dungeon
  - Manages the dungeon layout.
  - Controls:
    - Dungeon generation
    - Room management
  - Contains:
    - Room data such as tiles and entities.
    - The dungeon layout
- Player
  - Controls:
    - Movement
    - Room traversal
    - Weapons and combat
    - Item usage
    - Money count
  - Contains:
    - The camera
    - Player UI (hotbar and health)
    - Inventory data
- Enemy
  - Each enemy type should have different movement and attack patterns.
  - Try to make 1 enemy for each class to help keep multiple classes important.
- Projectiles
  - Each should have a move function and lifetime value.
  - The most basic projectiles will just move forward each frame and collide with walls and entities.
- Network Manager
  - Can either create a server or connect as a client.
  - Manages all networking, including packets.
  - Host has full control, and should send dungeon and entity data to each client.
  - Clients compute their own player movement and resync with the host.

## The Physics System

I have opted to avoid using a library like Pymunk for my physics system as it provides too many unnecessary tools that ultimately make the game's codebase more complex than it needs to be.

My physics system needs to do a few basic things, and nothing more:

- Allow objects to detect collisions between each other
- Resolve collisions and avoid tunneling (using swept AABBs[^3][^4])
- Mask out specific collision layers
  - e.g. enemies + enemy bullets do not need to collide
- Allow "move and slide" behaviour

  ![Sliding response to a swept AABB collision](https://uploads.gamedev.net/monthly_04_2013/ccs-146537-0-83526600-1366678432.png)

Something simple such as swept AABB collisions can solve this problem very easily and efficiently.
